                    pest-resistent plants.

                    other applied science.

                    different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
                    varieties for each major climate on Earth.

                    with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds

                    we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                    are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                    plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                    people were selecting the best breeds."
