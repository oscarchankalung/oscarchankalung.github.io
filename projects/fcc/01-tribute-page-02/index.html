								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									Albert Hofmann was a Swiss scientist who was intrigued by nature. This led him 
									to a career in chemistry in which he sought answers to his uncertainties. He 
									worked at Sandoz Laboratories where he nurtured his research work, and there he 
									made a lot of success working with various plants and converting them into 
									something useful. He became famous when he became the first person to produce 
									lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). In addition, he was also the first person to 
									taste it and learn about its hallucinogenic effects. He was deeply connected to 
									the nature and argued that LSD, besides being useful for psychiatry, could also 
									be used to promote awareness of mankind’s place in nature. However, he was 
									disappointed that his discovery was being carelessly used as a drug for 
									entertainment. Because of his discovery, LSD fans have fondly called him ‘The 
									Father of LSD.’ Besides carrying out his scientific experiments, he also authored 
									numerous books and more than 100 scientific articles. In 2007, he featured in a 
									list of the 100 greatest living geniuses, published by The Telegraph newspaper.

								<h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
								<ul>
										<li>
											Albert Hofmann was born in Baden, Switzerland, on January 11, 1906. He was
											the eldest of four children. His father was a poor toolmaker in a factory and 
											they lived in a rented apartment. He spent much of his childhood outdoors, 
											and grew up with a very deep connection with nature.
										</li>
										<li>
											He had mind-blowing experiences in childhood, wherein nature was changed in 
											magical ways that he didn’t understand. These experiences provoked questions 
											in his mind, and chemistry was the scientific field which allowed him to 
											understand them.
										</li>
										<li>
											He studied chemistry at Zurich University, his main interest being the 
											chemistry of plants and animals. At 23, he earned his PhD with honors.
										</li>
								</ul>
								<h2 id="tribute-head">Career</h2>
								<ul>
										<li>
											He took a job with Sandoz Laboratories; he was attracted by their program to 
											produce pharmacological compounds from medicinally important plants.
										</li>
										<li>
											He first synthesized LSD on November 16, 1938 with an aim to obtain a 
											respiratory and circulatory stimulant. The research was set aside for five 
											years.
										</li>
										<li>
											He stumbled on LSD again when he was working on the ergot fungus on April 16 
											1943. He accidentally ate a trace of the compound and came to know about its 
											powerful effects.
										</li>
										<li>
											On April 19, 1943, he deliberately swallowed a dose of LSD and rode his 
											bicycle home as the effects of the drug engulfed him. That day was remembered 
											by LSD enthusiasts as “bicycle day.”
										</li>
										<li>
											In 1958, Hofmann discovered ‘ethacetin’, which is an 'intoxicating 
											tryptamine.’
										</li>
										<li>
											He became director of the natural products department at Sandoz Laboratories. 
											He continued studying hallucinogenic substances found in Mexican mushrooms 
											and other plants. He produced ‘psilocybin’, the active agent of many ‘magic 
											mushrooms.’
										</li>
										<li>
											He also became interested in the seeds of the Mexican morning glory and found 
											that the active compound ‘ergine’ (LSA, ‘lysergic acid amide’), has a 
											distinct likeness to LSD.
										</li>
										<li>
											Hofmann also produced other important drugs like ‘methergine’, for treating 
											postpartum hemorrhaging, which was the leading cause of death from 
											childbirth.
										</li>
										<li>
											In 1962, he and his wife Anita Hofmann went to Mexico to search for the plant 
											‘Ska Maria Pastora’ to identify its active compound. However, he was not able 
											to identify it at that time. It was later identified as the ‘diterpenoid 
											salvinorin A’.
										</li>
										<li>
											In 1963, he attended the annual convention of the ‘World Academy of Arts and 
											Sciences’ (WAAS) in Stockholm.
										</li>
										<li>
											He stayed with Sandoz Laboratories as head of the research department for 
											natural medicines until he retired in 1971.
										</li>
										<li>
											He delivered a speech at the 1996 Worlds of Consciousness Conference in 
											Heidelberg, Germany.
										</li>
										<li>
											In an interview before he turned 100, Hoffman called LSD “medicine for the 
											soul.” He was disappointed that it was prohibited worldwide, knowing that it 
											has been very successful in psychoanalysis. However, he acknowledged that it 
											could be dangerous if misused, especially if given to a first-time user 
											without supervision from a doctor.
										</li>
								</ul>

										"I was completely astonished by the beauty of natuer. Our eyes see just a small 
										fraction of the light in the world. It is a trick to make a colored world, 
										which does not exist outside of human beings."<br><br>-- Albert Hofmann
