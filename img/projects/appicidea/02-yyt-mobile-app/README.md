## Description

Yan Yue Tong is one of the leading ginseng and dried seafood chain stores in Hong Kong, with more than 18 retail shops. The client has been using an existing point of sale (POS) solution for their offline retail business. This project is a mobile app that incorporates the offline and online shopping experience, while providing a new loyalty program.

## Outcome

This project was under UAT as I left the company. 90% of the frontend was finished for client to review. They were still working on discount products and the membership program. It is expected the product would have thousands of users.
