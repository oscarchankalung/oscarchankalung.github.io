## Description

The [JC InnoPower: Fellowship for Teachers and Social Workers](https://jcinnopower.hk/en) is a talent development program aims to build the innovative capacity of teachers and social workers in Hong Kong. The program encourages them to innovate in response to educational and social challenges, thereby contributing to the long-term development of these sectors.

This project is a mobile web app created for the carers of dementia patients. The app is an online platform that allows carers to record the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, thereby discovering a pattern and facilitating care-taking. The carers can record a dementia outburst by answering a questionnaire and view the records. The information will be shared with the doctors for further analysis. The carers can also make an appointment with the doctors using the app.

## Outcome

This project was under UAT as I left the company. 90% of the frontend were finished for clients to review. It is expected the website would serve hundreds of users.
